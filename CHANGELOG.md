# Changelog

Notable changes to `@animalabs/context-manager`, loosely following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Entries land with the change
that causes them — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#changelog).

Releases up to and including 0.6.2 predate this file; for their contents see
`git log` and the
[releases page](https://github.com/anima-research/context-manager/releases).

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Compression-refusal fallback admission now uses provider-aware total input
  usage after the canonical call (including disjoint Anthropic/Bedrock cache
  counters without double-counting subset-style providers), fails closed on
  zero/partial/unknown usage, and versions the durable accounting contract so
  legacy byte-bound quarantines remain evidence without consuming the repaired
  per-chunk shape allowance.
- Append-only autobiographical compiles now preserve the previous request's
  endpoint as an explicit cache breakpoint, avoiding recent-tail cache misses
  when a tool-heavy turn appends more than the provider's 20-block lookback.
- Compression recall pairs now follow canonical message-store order rather
  than lexical source-ID order, preserving chronology and stable prompt-cache
  prefixes when decimal message IDs cross a width boundary (for example,
  `"99"` to `"100"`).

## 0.6.3 — 2026-08-03

### Added

- **`chunkBoundaryHint` — a subclass seam for semantic chunk boundaries.**
  Strategies with domain knowledge about conversation structure (chat-topic
  transitions, episode breaks) can close a chunk early at a semantic boundary
  without forking `rebuildChunks` — hinted closes persist chunk records and
  respect the minimum-size and tool_use-pairing guards exactly like size-based
  closes. Motivation: connectome-host's FrontdeskStrategy forked the whole
  chunker for topic-aware boundaries and silently bypassed chunk-record
  persistence and the fail-closed orphan guard.
- **Budget-saturation liveness gates** (`test/long-context-saturation.test.ts`)
  — the regression net for the 2026-08-03 production outage class (hierarchical
  renderer saturating its fixed budget into a terminal `UncoveredDropError`
  refusal loop): the adaptive path must compile every turn of a workload whose
  raw history is several times the budget, and under pathological pressure may
  refuse only with the recoverable `OverBudgetError` class, never an uncovered
  drop.

### Changed

- The adaptive path's tail-shortfall and newest-turn-retention refusals now
  name their stage (`Tail emission dropped reserved recent-window messages`,
  `Structural repair did not retain the newest turn`) instead of masquerading
  as picker exhaustion with impossible arithmetic ("742 tokens still exceed
  hard budget 11220").
