# Changelog

Notable changes to `@animalabs/context-manager`, loosely following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Entries land with the change
that causes them, as fragment files in [`changelog.d/`](changelog.d/) that are
folded into a version section at release time — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#changelog).

Releases up to and including 0.6.2 predate this file; for their contents see
`git log` and the
[releases page](https://github.com/anima-research/context-manager/releases).

## Unreleased

### Changed

- The cache-breakpoint slot contract with membrane is now stated explicitly
  at `placeCacheMarkers` and enforced with a compile-time assertion: this
  strategy holds first claim on up to 3 message-level markers of Anthropic's
  4 `cache_control` slots; membrane is residual claimant on the remainder
  (tools/system fallback when no message markers arrive, and its tool-loop
  floating cache marker). The previous comment justified the 3-cap with a
  membrane behavior — an unconditional system-block marker — that membrane
  dropped some time ago, which left the fourth slot unclaimed and unnoticed
  while tool-loop suffixes went uncached (the qa-ops 2026-08-20 incident).
  No placement behavior changes; a future edit that emits a fourth marker
  now fails loudly at compile time instead of surfacing as a hard 400 or as
  membrane silently losing its float.

### Added

- **`recallEnvelope` — opt-in structural delimiting for recall answers.**
  A recall answer has never had an end delimiter: the Q-side label opens the
  memory and the turn boundary is all that closes it, and instances have been
  observed reading past the end of a recalled memory into unrelated content.
  With `recallEnvelope: 'xml'` every recall answer's prose is fenced by
  `<cm-recall id="…" level="…" span="…">` … `</cm-recall>`, on the presented
  window (both select paths) and on the mint/merge recall ladders alike.
  Attributes are sourced from the summary record and omitted when it cannot
  answer for one; content is never entity-escaped (the envelope is a
  collision-tolerant delimiter convention, not parseable XML); reasoning
  carriers are left byte-identical; Q-side labels are unchanged in both modes,
  so zero-recall surgery keys on exactly what it always did. The recall-pair
  budget prices each summary's actual envelope string. Under
  `maxMessageTokens` a capped answer is truncated as prose and enveloped
  afterwards, so opener and closer survive every cap. Default `'none'`
  renders byte-identically to before.
- Compression and merge requests now carry prompt-cache breakpoints at their
  stability strata — end of head window, last level≥2 recall pair, last
  recall pair — with a 1h cache TTL (#37). The mint lane previously sent its
  entire recall prefix (~60–93% of input) uncached on every call. Markers are
  suppressed when the recall ladder was budget-capped (front-eviction shifts
  the prefix, making cache writes counterproductive), and stale block-level
  `cache_control` riding replayed imported content is stripped so the seams
  can never push a request past Anthropic's 4-breakpoint limit. New options:
  `compressionCacheMarkers` (default `true`) and `compressionCacheTtl`
  (default `'1h'`).

### Fixed

- Compression-refusal fallback admission now uses provider-aware total input
  usage after the canonical call (including disjoint Anthropic/Bedrock cache
  counters without double-counting subset-style providers), fails closed on
  zero/partial/unknown usage, and versions the durable accounting contract so
  legacy byte-bound quarantines remain evidence without consuming the repaired
  per-chunk shape allowance.
- Append-only autobiographical compiles now preserve the previous request's
  endpoint as an explicit cache breakpoint, avoiding recent-tail cache misses
  when a tool-heavy turn appends more than the provider's 20-block lookback.
- Compression recall pairs now follow canonical message-store order rather
  than lexical source-ID order, preserving chronology and stable prompt-cache
  prefixes when decimal message IDs cross a width boundary (for example,
  `"99"` to `"100"`).

## 0.6.3 — 2026-08-03

### Added

- **`chunkBoundaryHint` — a subclass seam for semantic chunk boundaries.**
  Strategies with domain knowledge about conversation structure (chat-topic
  transitions, episode breaks) can close a chunk early at a semantic boundary
  without forking `rebuildChunks` — hinted closes persist chunk records and
  respect the minimum-size and tool_use-pairing guards exactly like size-based
  closes. Motivation: connectome-host's FrontdeskStrategy forked the whole
  chunker for topic-aware boundaries and silently bypassed chunk-record
  persistence and the fail-closed orphan guard.
- **Budget-saturation liveness gates** (`test/long-context-saturation.test.ts`)
  — the regression net for the 2026-08-03 production outage class (hierarchical
  renderer saturating its fixed budget into a terminal `UncoveredDropError`
  refusal loop): the adaptive path must compile every turn of a workload whose
  raw history is several times the budget, and under pathological pressure may
  refuse only with the recoverable `OverBudgetError` class, never an uncovered
  drop.

### Changed

- The adaptive path's tail-shortfall and newest-turn-retention refusals now
  name their stage (`Tail emission dropped reserved recent-window messages`,
  `Structural repair did not retain the newest turn`) instead of masquerading
  as picker exhaustion with impossible arithmetic ("742 tokens still exceed
  hard budget 11220").
