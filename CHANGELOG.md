# Changelog

Notable changes to `@animalabs/context-manager`, loosely following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Entries land with the change
that causes them, as fragment files in [`changelog.d/`](changelog.d/) that are
folded into a version section at release time — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#changelog).

Releases up to and including 0.6.2 predate this file; for their contents see
`git log` and the
[releases page](https://github.com/anima-research/context-manager/releases).

## Unreleased

### Changed

- The cache-breakpoint slot contract with membrane is now stated explicitly
  at `placeCacheMarkers` and enforced with a compile-time assertion: this
  strategy holds first claim on up to 3 message-level markers of Anthropic's
  4 `cache_control` slots; membrane is residual claimant on the remainder
  (tools/system fallback when no message markers arrive, and its tool-loop
  floating cache marker). The previous comment justified the 3-cap with a
  membrane behavior — an unconditional system-block marker — that membrane
  dropped some time ago, which left the fourth slot unclaimed and unnoticed
  while tool-loop suffixes went uncached (the qa-ops 2026-08-20 incident).
  No placement behavior changes; a future edit that emits a fourth marker
  now fails loudly at compile time instead of surfacing as a hard 400 or as
  membrane silently losing its float.

### Added

- Effective configuration is now readable, with the layer that supplied each
  key: `resolveEffectiveConfig(layers, semantics)` collapses ordered named
  layers into `{ effective, provenance }`, and `strategy.configProvenance`
  exposes that map for an autobiographical or knowledge instance
  (`'library-default'`, `'caller'`, `'knowledge-enforced'`, or whatever a host
  names its own layers). Values previously coalesced through `??`-chains across
  52 default sites, so the effective value of a key was recoverable only by
  reconstructing the chain by hand and the layer that supplied it was not
  recoverable at all. `semantics` is stated per call rather than assumed:
  `'skip-nullish'` reads a layer's `undefined`/`null` as "not supplied" (the
  `??` rule, and what a host stacking env/profile layers wants), while
  `'spread-fidelity'` lets a layer's own keys win exactly as
  `{ ...defaults, ...caller }` assigns them. The strategies resolve with
  spread fidelity, which is what their constructors always did, so no caller's
  effective config changed — including callers passing an explicit `undefined`
  or `null`, where the two readings differ.
- New option `logEffectiveConfig` (default `false`): one structured
  `config:effective` line on stderr carrying every effective key with its
  source, for operators who want the resolved picture in their logs rather than
  through a debugger. It is emitted at strategy initialization rather than at
  construction, so a subclass instance reports the strategy it actually is.
  The line carries a third field, `presentAsUndefined`: keys a caller supplied
  as explicit `undefined` stay present in the effective config but cannot
  survive JSON, so they are named there instead — every provenance key is
  either valued in `effective` or listed in `presentAsUndefined`, never both.
- `ContextManager.setSystemPrompt(text)` threads the host's live system prompt
  into memory-minting LLM requests — both L1 chunk compression and level
  merges — as the request's `system` field, ahead of the identity head, the
  same layout a live activation uses. On hosts whose identity and conduct live
  in system voice, a summarizer that never sees that prompt is a different
  agent from the one whose memory it writes: without it, memories were authored
  by a system-promptless variant of the agent and merges re-summarized those
  summaries upward. Note WHICH prompt a mint is served. The rest of the request
  is built as-of the span being compressed — same head, same recall ladder, no
  tail after the chunk — but the prompt is not: it lives in a single slot with
  no per-message history, so a mint gets the identity policy in force AT MINT
  TIME. That equals what the original instance was served exactly insofar as
  the host keeps the prompt stable across the compressed span; where it has
  changed, the memory is authored under the current policy and the older text
  is not recoverable from here. The hook mirrors `setToolDefinitions`: hosts
  push on every activation, an empty or `undefined` push never downgrades the
  recorded value. Opt-in — with the setter never called, mint requests keep
  their exact previous shape, carrying no `system` key at all, so canonical
  request hashes and compression quarantine identities are unchanged. Hosts
  that do set it also give a marker-less mint (first mint, capped ladder,
  markers off) a cache breakpoint on the system block via membrane's existing
  no-message-breakpoint fallback, which previously had nowhere to land on this
  lane.
- **`recallEnvelope` — opt-in structural delimiting for recall answers.**
  A recall answer has never had an end delimiter: the Q-side label opens the
  memory and the turn boundary is all that closes it, and instances have been
  observed reading past the end of a recalled memory into unrelated content.
  With `recallEnvelope: 'xml'` every recall answer's prose is fenced by
  `<cm-recall id="…" level="…" span="…">` … `</cm-recall>`, on the presented
  window (both select paths) and on the mint/merge recall ladders alike.
  Attributes are sourced from the summary record and omitted when it cannot
  answer for one; content is never entity-escaped (the envelope is a
  collision-tolerant delimiter convention, not parseable XML); reasoning
  carriers are left byte-identical; Q-side labels are unchanged in both modes,
  so zero-recall surgery keys on exactly what it always did. The recall-pair
  budget prices each summary's actual envelope string. Under
  `maxMessageTokens` a capped answer is truncated as prose and enveloped
  afterwards, so opener and closer survive every cap. Default `'none'`
  renders byte-identically to before.
- Compression and merge requests now carry prompt-cache breakpoints at their
  stability strata — end of head window, last level≥2 recall pair, last
  recall pair — with a 1h cache TTL (#37). The mint lane previously sent its
  entire recall prefix (~60–93% of input) uncached on every call. Markers are
  suppressed when the recall ladder was budget-capped (front-eviction shifts
  the prefix, making cache writes counterproductive), and stale block-level
  `cache_control` riding replayed imported content is stripped so the seams
  can never push a request past Anthropic's 4-breakpoint limit. New options:
  `compressionCacheMarkers` (default `true`) and `compressionCacheTtl`
  (default `'1h'`).
- Mint request preimages can now be persisted, so `provenance.requestHash` is
  readable and not merely verifiable. The field's contract said the hash "keys
  the exact request in the llm-calls log" — a log this library never wrote: the
  only library-owned log is the JSONL telemetry behind
  `CONTEXT_MANAGER_COMPRESSION_LOG`, off unless a host sets it, and the
  `llm-calls` files are host-harness artifacts. With the option on, every
  accepted L1 and merge mint stores its authoring request in the same Chronicle
  store as the summary, retrievable by the hash the summary already carries.
  Read it with `getMintRequestByHash(store, hash)` or
  `getMintRequestPreimageBytes(store, hash)` (new public exports); ask what one
  costs with `describeStoredMintPreimage(store, hash)`. Refused and quarantined
  attempts are not mints and are not stored.
- New option: `persistMintPreimages`, **opt-in, default `false`**. Absent
  config means off — only an explicit `true` enables it. Preimage text is real
  growth at mint cadence (a mint request is a whole compression context) and
  this library ships no retention knob for it yet, so a fleet that deploys from
  a checkout would otherwise have every resident begin writing preimages on the
  next pull. Turning it on is a deliberate act, taken with an eye on store size.
- Inline media is stored by REFERENCE, not re-embedded. A mint replays raw
  history, so one preimage can carry megabytes of base64 image content, and
  content-addressing cannot dedupe it across mints: the blob key is the hash of
  the whole request and no two mints send the same request. Media-bearing
  preimages are therefore stored as an envelope — the request's own JSON text
  plus references to the media blobs `MessageStore` already put in the store —
  and reads splice the base64 back in. Text-only preimages are unchanged: the
  plain request blob under its own digest. What comes back out of the read APIs
  is the original request bytes either way; the splice is verified against
  `requestHash` when it is written and again when it is read, and a damaged
  store raises `MintPreimageMaterializationError` rather than quietly returning
  something else.
- Preimages are persisted best-effort: a store failure never blocks the mint
  and leaves no preimage, so a reader gets null — alongside the two other
  absence causes, pre-feature mints and persistence left off. The hash on the
  entry stays verifiable either way.

### Fixed

- `provenance.requestHash` now identifies the request the transport actually
  ACCEPTED. In the carrier-transport degraded path both mint sites sent a
  reasoning-stripped copy of the request but hashed and persisted the
  original, so a summary authored by the stripped retry carried the hash of
  bytes the model never read: `sha256(preimage) === requestHash` verified
  green while the stored request was not the authoring one. L1 attempts and
  merges now hash, map and persist the accepted bytes.
- Compression-refusal fallback admission now uses provider-aware total input
  usage after the canonical call (including disjoint Anthropic/Bedrock cache
  counters without double-counting subset-style providers), fails closed on
  zero/partial/unknown usage, and versions the durable accounting contract so
  legacy byte-bound quarantines remain evidence without consuming the repaired
  per-chunk shape allowance.
- Append-only autobiographical compiles now preserve the previous request's
  endpoint as an explicit cache breakpoint, avoiding recent-tail cache misses
  when a tool-heavy turn appends more than the provider's 20-block lookback.
- Compression recall pairs now follow canonical message-store order rather
  than lexical source-ID order, preserving chronology and stable prompt-cache
  prefixes when decimal message IDs cross a width boundary (for example,
  `"99"` to `"100"`).

## 0.6.3 — 2026-08-03

### Added

- **`chunkBoundaryHint` — a subclass seam for semantic chunk boundaries.**
  Strategies with domain knowledge about conversation structure (chat-topic
  transitions, episode breaks) can close a chunk early at a semantic boundary
  without forking `rebuildChunks` — hinted closes persist chunk records and
  respect the minimum-size and tool_use-pairing guards exactly like size-based
  closes. Motivation: connectome-host's FrontdeskStrategy forked the whole
  chunker for topic-aware boundaries and silently bypassed chunk-record
  persistence and the fail-closed orphan guard.
- **Budget-saturation liveness gates** (`test/long-context-saturation.test.ts`)
  — the regression net for the 2026-08-03 production outage class (hierarchical
  renderer saturating its fixed budget into a terminal `UncoveredDropError`
  refusal loop): the adaptive path must compile every turn of a workload whose
  raw history is several times the budget, and under pathological pressure may
  refuse only with the recoverable `OverBudgetError` class, never an uncovered
  drop.

### Changed

- The adaptive path's tail-shortfall and newest-turn-retention refusals now
  name their stage (`Tail emission dropped reserved recent-window messages`,
  `Structural repair did not retain the newest turn`) instead of masquerading
  as picker exhaustion with impossible arithmetic ("742 tokens still exceed
  hard budget 11220").
